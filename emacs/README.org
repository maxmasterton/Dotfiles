#+TITLE: Doom Emacs Dependencies
#+AUTHOR: Max Masterton

In order to install this config you need to first install these packages (assuming that doom emacs and it's dependencies are already installed):
 + JetBrains Mono
 + mu and mbysnc

I'm not sure about other distros but arch packages are as follows:
 + community/ttf-jetbrains-mono
 + aur/mu
 + aur/mbsync-git
