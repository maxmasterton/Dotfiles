#+TITLE: Configiration file for Zsh (.zshrc)
#+DESCRIPTION: File used to customize the Z shell.
#+PROPERTY: header-args :tangle ~/.zshrc
#+AUTHOR: Max Masterton

* Notes
+ This config requires some packages, they can be seen in the README.org for this directory or they can be seen here.
+ They are the following:
  - zsh shell (community/zsh)
  - starship prompt (community/starship)
  - zsh-syntax-highlighting (community/zsh-syntax-highlighting)
  - ufetch (aur/ufetch)
  - exa (aur/exa)

* Config
** Colours
This enables colors in the shell (for example red : command invalid, green : command valid)

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
autoload -U colors && colors
#+END_SRC

** Autocomplete
This enables autocomplete, both in a list (when there are multiple options) and just standard tab complete when there is only one.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
autoload -U compinit
zstyle ':completion:*' menu select
zmodload zsh/complist
compinit
_comp_options+=(globdots)
#+END_SRC

** Starship Prompt
This is a cool prompt that displays language info and git info.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
eval "$(starship init zsh)"
#+END_SRC

** Ufetch
This is a minimalist alternative to neofetch that displays some more relevent infomation, there is also a simmilar version called pfetch but it's arch ASCAII art is quite ugly. There is a program that displays even better infomation called uwufetch, but it comes at a heavy price.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ufetch
#+END_SRC

** Aliases
These just speed some things up.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
alias ls="exa -la"
alias doom="~/.emacs.d/bin/doom"
#+END_SRC

** Zsh-syntax-highlighting
This needs to be at the end of the document

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
source /usr/share/zsh/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting/zsh-syntax-highlighting.zsh 2>/dev/null
#+END_SRC
